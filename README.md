# Object Detection - YOLOv5
 ## Introduction
YOLOv5 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that is incredibly fast and accurate. It’s the fifth iteration of the “You Only Look Once” (YOLO) family of models, and it’s been optimized for speed, accuracy, and ease of use.

## Installation
To get started with YOLOv5, you’ll first need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git```

```cd yolov5``` 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
Once you’ve installed YOLOv5, you can use it to detect objects in images or videos. Here’s a basic example:

```python detect.py --source /path/to/your/image.jpg``` 

This will output an image with bounding boxes drawn around detected objects, along with their class labels and confidence scores.

## Training

To train your own model on custom data, you’ll need to organize your dataset in the correct format and modify the configuration file to match your dataset. Then, you can train your model with the following command:

```python train.py --img 640 --batch 16 --epochs 100 --data /path/to/your/data.yaml --cfg ./models/yolov5s.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --name yolov5s_results```

## Results


YOLOv5 provides detailed results after each training run, including precision-recall curves, confusion matrices, and more. These can be found in the ```runs/train/yolov5s_results```directory.

## Conclusion

YOLOv5 is a powerful tool for real-time object detection. Whether you’re interested in detecting objects in images or video, or training your own custom model, YOLOv5 provides an easy-to-use, high-performance solution.

Please note that this is a simplified overview of using YOLOv5. For more detailed instructions and advanced usage options, please refer to the official YOLOv5 repository.
